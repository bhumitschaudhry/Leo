🚀 From zero to a Gemini-like AI clone in just 10 minutes!

I just built "Leo" — a lightweight, high-performance chat interface powered by Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash. 

What's cool about it?
✅ Modern UI with a sleek "Bright Orange" gradient.
✅ Dual Mode: Run it with a Node.js backend or as a static site (BYOK - Bring Your Own Key).
✅ Smooth Light/Dark mode transitions.

The best part? The entire process took me less than 10 minutes using Antigravity. It’s incredible how much speed and precision an agentic AI coding assistant can bring to the development workflow.

Check it out if you're looking for a minimal but powerful way to interact with Gemini!
